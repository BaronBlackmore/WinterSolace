        <h2 id="intro">Simple. Fast. Free.</h2>
        <p>Developers &amp; press both have the same goal: to bring 
great games to as many people as possible - after all, a good game is 
worth nothing if no-one plays it. For the press, finding out about a 
game but not having access to information &amp; media for the game means
 that they can't write about it. Of course, developers want to spend 
their valuable time making games instead of press pages. </p>
		<p><strong>presskit()</strong> (pronounced '<em>do presskit</em>') is 
the solution. Free for everyone, open and easy-to-use for both 
developers &amp; press. Developers only have to spend an hour or so 
creating well-laid out press pages with everything the press needs to 
write to their hearts desire. Everybody wins.</p>

        <div class="clear">
    
        <h2 id="what">What is presskit()?</h2>
        <p>
        </p><ul>
            <li>Beautiful, optimized and efficient press pages in 30-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Usable by anyone who knows what FTP, text editing &amp; image editing means.</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; painless 'Single File Upload'-installation.</li>
            <li>Created using feedback of prominent journalists &amp; indie developers.</li>
            <li>Optional, seamless integration with <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
    
        <div class="clear">
    
        <h2 id="beta">What does beta mean?</h2>
        <p>presskit() is currently in beta, which means that all 
functionality is in there, but not everything has been tested. It also 
means that I officially take no responsibility for your 
presskit()-installation whatsoever. While I've tested it extensively and
 presskit() is incapable of damaging, deleting or modifying anything 
above its root installation directory, it might suddenly stop working, 
have some rough patches or not do exactly what you want. That's part of 
the deal.</p>

        <div class="clear">

        <h2 id="update">What is new in presskit()?</h2>
        <p>presskit() is currently in beta, which means new functions 
get added every now and then. Since its launch in early May, a lot of 
functions have been added. The <a href="http://dopresskit.com/manual.pdf">manual</a> has info on anything listed here that is not explained. These functions have been added recently:
        </p><ul>
        <li>Quickly create an easy a valid allowance or restriction for 
Let's Play-ers or Video Content Creators through the 
&lt;monetization-permission&gt; tag.</li>
        <li>Handle your press lists and build distribution by integrating with the free companion service to presskit(), <a href="https://dodistribute.com/">distribute()</a>.</li>
        <li>Integrate easily with <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> to keep track of who, when and from where visits to your presskit() are made.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="free">Why is presskit() free?</h2>
        <p>The goal of creating presskit() was to save myself and the people in the press that want to write about <a href="https://vlambeer.com/">Vlambeer</a> as much time as possible.</p><p>As
 development of presskit() furthered,  an increasing amount of fellow 
independent game creators asked about how easy it was to implement. This
 convinced me that this little project could make life easier for a lot 
more people than just myself.</p><p>presskit(), in the spirit of 
independent developers helping eachother out when it comes to making 
games or doing business, is completely free for anyone to use.</p>
    
        <div class="clear">

        <h2 id="thanks">presskit() was only possible thanks to these fine folks!</h2>
        <p><strong>presskit()</strong> was created in just over a week by <a href="https://www.ramiismail.com/">Rami Ismail</a> of Dutch independent game studio <a href="https://www.vlambeer.com/">Vlambeer</a>.
 Rami does the business &amp; development at Vlambeer and found himself 
looking for an efficient solution to press kits. presskit() was the 
result, but it wouldn't have been if it weren't for the following fine
