Missing from my previous post is another key ingredient in writing music: the song needs to be about something; to have a focus or a message to convey (seems so obvious now). The song that I've developed here is the theme tune to the main antagonist of my game, Winter Solace.

The character is referred to for now as the dark man. His whole deal is being charismatic and ambiguous in motive, while appearing quite easy-going and supportive. To reflect this, I wanted his theme to be a bit shady, but upbeat, maybe a bit casino-like and jaunty, with a flexible melody to use as a motif in other songs in the game.
Motifs are something that Pixar does particularly well. Think about the main melody in Up or Toy Story, they’re first used in happy moments to associate the tunes with a happy relationship. Later when they’re played in a sad moment, it’s the juxtaposition of what the melody is telling you and what’s being shown which is really hard-hitting.
